            ## About NYC Restaurant Safety

            When analyzing restaurant safety across New York City neighborhoods, we've discovered some 
            fascinating patterns in our data. For instance, {best_neighborhood} leads with the best 
            average safety scores, showing a strong commitment to food safety standards.

            ### By the Numbers
            - **{total_inspections:,}** total inspections conducted
            - **{grade_a_percentage:.1f}%** of restaurants maintain an A grade
            - Average safety score: **{avg_score:.1f}** (lower is better)
            - {worst_score:.0f} points was the highest (worst) score recorded

            ### Understanding Scores
            Restaurant scores are calculated based on violation points:
            - **Grade A**: 0-13 points (Excellent)
            - **Grade B**: 14-27 points (Good)
            - **Grade C**: 28+ points (Poor)

            ### Timing Matters
            - Inspections happen throughout the year
            - Scores can vary by season and inspection type
            - Regular inspections help maintain high safety standards

            ### Data Insights
            - Violations are weighted based on health risk
            - Critical violations carry more points
            - Repeat violations face stricter penalties

            ### About This Tool
            This application visualizes health inspection data from NYC's Department of Health, 
            helping you make informed dining decisions. Data is sourced from the 
            [NYC Open Data API](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j) 
            and updated regularly.
