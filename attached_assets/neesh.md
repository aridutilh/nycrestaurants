# NEESH KANCHARLA

## FRONTEND ENGINEER

## WHO I AM

Hey! I’m Kanishq (Neesh) Kancharla. Welcome to my little corner of the internet.

I’m a frontend engineer, and I'm dedicated to building unique interfaces and digital experiences that make websites exceptional. Check out my recent work at [Corner](https://corner.inc) below.

I’m also a sophomore at Northeastern University, studying computer science with a human-centered computing concentration.

Right now, I’m looking for a full-time co-op this winter (Jan-May). If you think we would be a good fit, let me know!
